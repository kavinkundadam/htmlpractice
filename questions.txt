Why are there only 6 <h> tags?

    The number six was not arbitrary. When HTML was first created by Tim Berners-Lee, it was based on the Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML), 
    which itself utilized six levels of headings. The structure was designed to facilitate the exchange of academic and technical documents, and six levels 
    were considered a sufficient "sweet spot" for most document hierarchies in academia and publishing. 

    <h1>: The main title or subject of the entire page.
    <h2>: Section titles.
    <h3>: Sub-section titles within an <h2> section.
    <h4> - <h6>: Further, less important levels of subheadings.
